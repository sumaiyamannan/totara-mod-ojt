=== 9.3 ===

* The index totacompimpocour_evi_ix on the table totara_compl_import_course was changed to allow
non-unique values. This was done to allow compatibility with SQL Server given that the evidenceid field
can contain multiple null values. Non-unique values, other than null, should still not be added to
the evidenceid field in this table.

* The index totacompimpocert_evi_ix on the table totara_compl_import_cert was changed to allow
non-unique values. This was done to allow compatibility with SQL Server given that the evidenceid field
can contain multiple null values. Non-unique values, other than null, should still not be added to
the evidenceid field in this table.
