# auth_catadmin

This version is for Moodle 2.7 to 3.4. Use the master branch for versions above 3.4

auth_catadmin contains large parts of auth_saml2 since it is a copy of it, just with the bits we don't need because the two plugins can share them removed.
 
auth_catadmin allows us run additional SSO logins without interfering with auth_saml2 settings or data.

It requires auth_saml2 version 2019062601 to work.
